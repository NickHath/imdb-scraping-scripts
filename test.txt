This movie is utter trash. Pure and simple.I could go on about the atrocious acting, mediocre gore, run-of-the-mill baddies and so on and so forth but instead I'm gonna tell you this - stay away from this trash.I do love myself a good clown horror - clowns have this mix of "always smiling, yet at the same time emotionless" type of thing. These clown all lack that. Some people will go for this flick because of the nudity which again - it is there, but in this movie you end up feeling like "tits? oh whatever". Unless you are a teenage boy you are going to roll your eyes and fast forward to the next scene. To avoid acting that is.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Jon Watt's "Clown" is one option.After the opening teaser, we get 30 minutes of set up. Our four main characters are headed for a concert in Columbus, Ohio. They are lured into a strange town due to Jill's (Katie Keene) lost cell phone. While there they get stranded and fight killer clowns for nearly an hour as they tie this into the opening teaser, classic formula writing.Unless you have a thing about people with clown make-up (budget doesn't allow costumes) then you can skip this slasher. The characters were boring as was the over-all plot that never adequately explained how a town can exist with a bunch of clown killers. Kaitlyn Sapp plays Jamie the babysitter who finds a necklace with the word "Kaitlyn" from the previous sitter. Seems they just went with her own necklace.Guide: F-word, Brief nudity (Kaitlyn Sapp)Before watching it, I knew nothing about this movie. Just that people who liked movies I watched had liked it. I guess I was expecting it to be a Troma-type low budget gore fest but it was more, and somehow less at the same time. It had the look and feel of a big budget movie but the script and acting of a movie made by children. While they managed to get the hot girl naked and murdered before the opening credits, it wasn't so good after that. At one point a girl loses her phone. After driving for a long time they decide to call her phone and the guy who answers tells them to keep driving and make the next left and he will meet them there. And they do it! One thing that distinguished this from a Troma flick was the distinct lack of gore. We see the hot girl get killed by a machete that doesn't even cut through her shirt and then later we see one bloodless stabbing. Overall I'd have to say this movie is very average for the genre. Definitely worth watching once.Whilst on their way to a concert, four friends get sidetracked and stranded in a seemingly abandoned town.Whilst looking for help, they find themselves stalked and terrorised by a gang of violent clown dressed psychopaths, who will stop at nothing ensnaring them into their sinister blood thirsty games......Clowns can be scary can't they?Arguably the scariest of all clowns is Pennywise, as he is literally the stuff made of nightmares. Then the Killer Klowns, whilst not the scariest clowns to grace small screen, have gained notoriety because the film is just so much fun.But then Sam Rockwell could argue that the awful Clownhouse is the scariest thing for him.......knowing its on his C.V.This has all the right ingredients for a decent horror come stalk and slash, but the end result is just a boring film that tries to hard to be an amalgamation of the later Friday films and a Rob Zombie film.So once the main narrative of the film commences (second act, always when one of the protagonists sees something overly bizarre), it's just so formulaic, and so lethargic, you are willing the clowns to walk just that little fast, kill the stupid kids and let the film just finish.So we are 'treated' to a wealth of horror film tropes, killers walking slowly and always getting who they want, protagonists making silly decisions that have been made since the late seventies, and the old man, who comes out of nowhere, who has never been harmed and should have minded his own business.It's pretty poor stuff,many horror fan would have seen this film dozens of times before, and not have let themselves get drawn in by the predictable decent DVD cover art.But fair dues, every once in a while, there is a little gem amongst the dirge and the filth, and sadly this isn't one of them.Borrowing from too many better horror films is always a mistake, because you remember just how good those were, whilst suffering this rubbish.Don't bother.Seems this film has divided IMDb forum folks into the "Worst Ever" and "I Liked It" groups. I can only say that within a bit of both is where the film falls.On the pro side, the film was well shot, not the typical for low budget hand held or camcorder affair. Lighting was also well done, never too dark, never too anything but mood appropriate. Also the music was well designed and used appropriately.Some nods to classic slashers were not unnoticed and were a welcome tip of the hat. Most prominently was a tip to "Halloween" with a key family named after the principal character (no not Myers). And if you are really into horror from all decades one of the killer clowns resembled Conrad Veidt from the silent thriller "The Man Who Laughs" (a man who is disfigured via torture to always have a wide grin - said to have been the inspiration for The Joker in the Batman comics).On the con side, well... acting was not anyone's strong suit. The clowns who had no dialog, sans the lone female laugh maker, fared best as ,w ell, they had no dialog! Everyone else was one dimensional, wooden, fiberglass... anything but natural.The script was abysmal as it had the characters doing some truly idiotic things; none of which ended well at all. First and foremost among the nonsense was the plot device used to lure the group heading to a concert to the almost abandoned town where "clowns ruled". How the clowns came to be rulers of the sorry place is never quite explained enough. Something to do with a train wreck and a couple creepy pre-teens (in the opening flashback; again a nod to "Halloween"). This lack of origin made for a nagging issue during the entire run. Hey, even Myers and Jason had background stories! I gave this a two based on the pros which are not really enough to recommend. Wait for Rob Zombie's "31".Coulrophobics beware and coulrophiles rejoice - it may not be a particularly original film, but it's well executed (no pun intended), great fun and thoroughly enjoyable. ClownTown was clearly shot on a very low budget, but still manages to deliver a well crafted homage to those much loved straight-to-video slashers of the early 80s. The camera-work, lighting, direction, soundtrack - especially the soundtrack - all manage to beautifully re-create a wonderfully evocative early John Carpenter feel as the film reliably works its way through various well worn horror genre tropes.Is it staggeringly original? No. Is it immaculately acted? Not particularly. But it is a well-crafted and unpretentiously entertaining B movie - and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I really wish I could have seen this at a drive-in, preferably on a hot summer night, somewhere around 1979. 6.5/10Found this on the shelves in Asda & had to buy, though skeptical of these types of films I still bought it.I can say after watching it was a lot better than what I thought it was! For a film that is Straight-to-DVD & sort of cheap looking it was actually really good! It was creepy, grim, gory, bloody & just really eerie too!The blood in the film was good, not as much as I'd want but it was good! The story was basic & straight forward but I can't complain on that too much as the film was decent! The clowns looked creepy & sinister as well & had a very uneasy vibe going on about it! The music added to the film as well with the child like chimes & drearyness!The favourite part I liked was when the clown got crushed by the rubbish lorry compactor! That was good & reminded me a lot like Child's Play 3 which was different but roughly the same!I give this a 7/10 as it was a lot better than what I had previewed though I did watch this with an open mind not caring on the outcome! But it was a pretty good film I'd recommend a watch to!That slogan goes for a lot of horror slashers, most of them are (slightly) guilty. But this story and the characters are beyond ridiculous. The opening scene is - unfortunately- the best part. A babysitter is at the Strode's residence while watching a TV news reporter named Weathers. Any horror fan can appreciate the nod to classics like "Halloween" and "Scream". The fun stops right there when the leading cast is introduced including a blond girl who is certainly no actress but only hired for her rack. You know you're in trouble when the last name of the director is also spotted several times in the cast and production crew. Anyway, four friends wait in a spooky town for a total stranger to bring one of the girl's phone. They wait for hours even though they're already late for the concert and the fact that the town seems abandoned, which doesn't seem to bother them at all. When the killer clowns arrive they're saved by an old hermit who hides them and calmly starts making dinner. There are killer clowns out there but life goes on, right ? The clowns aren't scary, just painted faces and not menacing or convincing because of the bad acting (even behind the painted faces that is..) The end reveals that the local sheriff is involved but since he's the one who told them to go there in the beginning of this wretched tale, it's insulting that it's supposed to be a twist. Some gore but hardly worth mentioning and even for fans of the genre (I'm one of them) it's a total letdown. Way too many bad films have been released the last 2 years and this is one of them.Maybe if this film had capitalized on the creep clown sightings that were all the rage last year, this film might have had something. Instead, this is a slavishly formula slasher film in the mold of "The Hills Have Eyes," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Wrong Turn," except with clowns. Very low budget, but so were the first two films I mentioned and they are both arguably horror classics, but this film lacks Hills or Chainsaw's suspense, originality, or even good old fashioned scares. This horror film is strictly running and chasing and creepy clown imagery. The creepy clown imagery was enough to hold my attention, but just barely.Traveling to a nearby concert, a group of friends get stranded in a remote, desolate town with another pair of travelers and being chased by a gang of deranged, homicidal clowns determined to kill them one-by-one and must find a way to stop them and get out alive.This here turned out to be quite the enjoyable effort. One of the more engaging efforts to this one is the way it manages to work out the group getting trapped at the town and setting up their inevitable being hunting down. Going for the group getting lost and then purposefully directed to their hunting grounds where the first incidents give this such a great starting point for the action to come later on. The groups' first encounter on the streets of the abandoned town where the near-accident leads into the clowns emerging and beating down the first of the group is a nice beginning, and leading into the ambush in the junkyard as well as the eventual escape gives the film a great sequence. The multitude of chases and the rather brutal action that emerges inside the abandoned facility where the great chases down in the bathrooms or the endless hallways lead into some really fun and exciting scenes of the clowns hunting them down, and the brawl out on the rooftop is exceptionally good which has a lot to like about it. The film's best action scenes in the finale really work nicely when they're captured and forced to brawl with the remaining gang of clowns makes for a rather fun time overall here, and once it gets to the big final escape here really gives this one some fun and somewhat chilling scenes that work rather nicely overall here. Alongside the brutal, graphic kills and the rather creepy look for the various clowns, these here hold this up over its minor flaws. The biggest issue is the fact that the simplistic story offers nothing about what's actually happening here. While the group is thrown right in with their encounters against the clowns, we get nothing about what's the point of being hunted or how the whole affair got started with a lame opening that gets tied into the rest of the story in a throwaway line that doesn't connect at all, and the reasoning for the whole story is really underwhelming. The other issue here is the fact that while the clowns look threatening, it's not that hard to laugh them off as lame as the fact that taking them on as a group would probably have saved themselves a lot of trouble against what they're trying to do and it really doesn't help this one much. Otherwise, it's not that bad of an effort.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity and mild drug use.In the beginning a group of 4 people are asking directions while one is holding a map. I thought, what year is this supposed to be set? Don't they have a GPS or google maps or something? Then about 5 minutes later while on the road, the driver notices they need petrol/gas. His girlfriend says something like 'let me check my phone to see if I can find a gas station'. I could see where this was going and stopped watching.Of course can't be sure if the persons responsible for this movie have some urinary problems (hopefully not cancer) but no other explanation I can think of for the constant references to urination, people peeing, scenes with urinals, women and men discussing their urination. It is all very strange. As for the movie itself, found it entertaining and with decent production values. Still, all this talk about peeing and pissing is odd, at least in my humble opinion. Perhaps for teenagers this is an "in" thing, I don't know.Clown Town was a good movie, I just barely watched it and I have to say it was pretty chilling and freaky. An entire town taken over by a bunch of freaky clowns is a chilling thought no doubt.The story goes like this, a group of four friends, two couples that is are going on a trip to a concert. They seem lost and stop at a cafe on the road to get directions, but one of the friends realizes that her phone is gone and goes into a panic because all of her personal identities are in there. The friends decide to call the phone and a mysterious man answers, he tells them he will meet them at a nearby town to deliver the phone. They go to this town and wait.When night comes and they are still waiting, things start to go to hell from there. They are attacked by clowns. And these clowns want to kill them.The reason I give Clown Town a 8 is because I feel there is more missing to the story then was shown. Like how the clowns came to be? How the family came to be complete nut cases? And I would have liked to know more about why the Husband went into hiding and how the wife became a psycho path just like her children? There was tons of stuff missing in the story, a good amount was explained by Frank the old crazy man, but not enough. I also give clown town a 8 because of the suspense in it, the way the friends are stranded and have no way out. The clowns also seem brain washed by something? But I would like to know what? Clown Town was a good horror movie, it kept you on the edge of your seat and made things tense. I like clown horror movies and this was not bad at all, but the story could have used more in it. I also felt it was kind of rushed, I like horror movies with more detail and story in them.Clown Town gets an 8
Because this film has been so stubbornly withheld from the home-video market, it has been years since the last time I saw it. Still, as a serious aficionado of fine acting, I still retain vivid memories of this lively flick and I can not understand all the negative reaction it received. The characters who populate this story are fascinating and memorably enacted by a superb cast. It would be little more than another typical caper flick were it not for the well-drawn weaknesses of the main characters which lead them inexorably into a high pressure situation from which they must try with all their might to escape. If you ever get to see this show, watch for the marvelous work of the numerous supporting players such as Richard Bradford. It is a deliciously glossy, stylish film but with a character-driven story that thoroughly engrossed me each time I saw it. It dances precariously between comedy and drama in a manner which I found intriguing and delightful. In view of all the bad reviews I have read about "Looking to Get Out" I deeply regret that it persists in being unavailable year after year. I would love to look at it again to try to figure out what causes so many folks to dislike it. Is it simply a matter of taste? I do not know.It is a common practice: it is enough that a false authority (most entertainment reporters who are no film critics, just regular spectators) dislikes something, for a choir of followers to repeat his opinion and create undeserved bad reputation for a cultural product. Such is the case of (among many others) "Born to Win", "The Hotel New Hampshire" and "Lookin' to Get Out", all the three curiously made in the 1980s, a difficult times in the history of the United States, under Ronald Reagan's dominant image. Respectively directed by Czech Ivan Passer, British Tony Richardson and American Hal Ashby, the three films had something valuable to say about US individuals, institutions and customs: be it the disintegration of the couple due to drug abuse, the dysfunction of nuclear families, consumerism or a certain vulgarity that may describe Las Vegas too well. None of the three films is a masterpiece, but they rise above the low scores and bad opinions that surround them. In particular, "Lookin' to Get Out (the director's cut) did not diminish at all the great admiration I have for Ashby, one of the most underrated American filmmakers, with a magnificent work that includes "The Landlord", "Harold and Maude", "The Last Detail", "Shampoo", "Bound for Glory", "Coming Home", "Being There" and the documentary "Let's Spend the Night Together", all containing his privileged perception of his fellow Americans and their cultures: who has ever made any two titles of those, has the liberty to make lesser films as "8 Million Ways to Die" or "Lookin' to Get Out", which are not bad at all. Written by Al Schwartz and Jon Voight, "Lookin' to Get Out" is a typical American film comedy drama about gambling buddies, prostituted women, exaggerated bad taste, and a peculiar cultural way of reacting to troubles, stuff that has being the basis of dozens of dramatic comedies, much worse than this, in which Voight and Burt Young try to get out of trouble, when they have to pay 10 thousand dollars in 24 hours, and the only solution they come up with is going to gamble in Las Vegas, where Ann-Margret crosses their path with a different agenda. The plot, which does not aspire for an award to originality, benefits however from the performances of the central cast (Voight, Young, Ann-Margret, Bert Remsen and Richard Bradford), without forgetting the contribution of a group of unknown faces that add weight to the story being told; from maestro Haskell Wexler's cinematography; and mainly in my opinion- from Ashby's hand, from his subtle and affectionate style to capture the fragility of the demented characters, to handle with caution the grotesque and violent, but without suppressing those events and attitudes that offend human dignity, day after day. If you find a copy of Ashby's cut, don't miss it. You will add another title to the gallery of good performances by Voight, Ann-Margret and Young, your appreciation of Ashby will not be affected a bit (unless you have overrated "Harold and Maude") and, as a bonus, you'll see Angelina Jolie (Voight) at six, playing her talented father's little girl. The extended version edition includes a reunion of the actors, who evoke Ashby's memories and his working method.I thought this film was excellent! I saw the extended version on DVD so uncertain what the clipped version looks like.Jon Voight is superlative as the annoying wise guy gambler. Burt Young doesn't appear to be acting as the NYC street wise buddy - he is that good or at least well cast. Ann-Margret nails it as the old girl-friend who can't quite get Voight's character Alex out of her system. She is smoldering every time she is on screen and she really keeps the viewer enthralled with all the male actors vying for attention. Her extended kiss as Patti Warner with Alex will jolt male and female viewers alike with its tenderness and anticipation!Should be required viewing for anyone with, or knows someone with a gambling addiction!Really combines some of the best elements of Ocean's 11, The Sting and Don Quixote. Don't miss the last 15 minutes to see who is conning who.The scene with real life father Jon Voight and daughter Angelina Jolie is not to be missed as it came off surreal to me. Watch and see what I mean.Before I get into my critique of "Lookin' To Get Out", I feel I should mention that I saw the original theatrical cut of the movie via finding an old VHS release of the movie. Supposedly, the DVD release of this movie runs 15 extra minutes and supposedly improves the movie. That may be the case, but from what I saw, I can't see any extra footage making a big improvement of the mess that I saw. True, the DVD cut may explain a number of unanswered questions the original cut had, like why one character has bandages over one of his eyes. But the movie would still have a slow and plot less feel - it frequently feels that the actors are making it up as they go along. And while I think Voight and Young are talented actors, they give extremely annoying performances. The only thing that survives intact is the performance by Bert Remsen as the professional gambler - he's colorful, and commands the screen in his scenes. But even he can't save the movie enough to make it worth watching.Novices will dismiss this gorgeous movie as drek, pointing out that the only "good" thing about it was Angelina Jolie when she was 4 years old. First of all, anyone who is an Angelina "fan" has problems of their own, and are in no position to criticize anything, much less art, like this great movie.Put simply, this is the best movie about friendship I have ever seen. The writing is spectacular, as Jon Voight really understood how to express to the audience the love these two guys had as friends. The subtleties in the acting are wonderful to watch, like when Alex (Voight's character) yells at Jerry (Burt Young's character) for losing all his money at the race track. He screams at him, but then remembers that his friend is his friend, faults and all, and walks up to Jerry, pats him on the back and says, "Come on, let's go get some breakfast." The physicality of the pat on the back was a lovely touch, just like the Italian brothers fighting on the beach in "Big Night".  The brothers "fought" with love, not really hitting each other. The two guys in "Looking to get Out" accept each other with all their faults, like no other two characters I've ever seen in film or TV. One scene has Jerry telling a p***ed off casino owner that his friend (Alex) doesn't understand how impossible he (Alex)is, but that he (Jerry) does, and that's why he's his friend. To which a very indignant Alex (Voight) says to the casino owner, "How 'bout that?", and the two of them walk out together, having lost all their money, up to thier necks in deep ca-ca, but still having each other.  Yet another wonderful moment in the film is when Alex has gotten them into more trouble, and Jerry says this about Alex... "You know, he's a great guy to have in a jam.  Problem is that he's the one who got you into the jam in the first place."  Great writing, wonderfully acted by all the cast.This film is rich. Rich with one-liners, rich with wonderful characters all the way around, and rich in humanity. This is a gorgeous film, and if you're ever lucky enough to see it, grab it, and never let it go. Of all of Jon Voight's movies, this would be the one I'd like to talk with him about. What a gem! "Coming Home", "Midnight Cowboy", "Table For Five", yes, they're good, but "Looking To Get Out" stands alone. Of course you have to understand film and writing to appreciate it. You can't just be in the Angelina Jolie fan club."Lookin' To Get Out" was a bit of an ego project for actor Jon Voight, who wrote, starred and partially financed the film. Voight, unable to get a director to shoot his script, hired Hal Ashby, who at the time was stuck in an existential rut, smoking cocaine and drinking booze.The film, a 17 million dollar flop, stars Voight and Burt Young as a couple of New York losers who lose $10,00 in a poker game. They thus go to Las Vegas hoping to win back some big bucks. In Vegas the two hook up with former call girl Ann-Margret, set up headquarters in the MGM Grand Hotel, and break the bank in the casino. Reportedly, director Hal Ashby's cut of the film was heavily chopped by both Paramount and Voight. The result is a mess, as much of the film's dialogue seems badly improvised, and the entire film consists of Voight showing off, each scene crafted simply to prove how great and gritty an actor he is. It's all very vain.7/10 - This review was based on a very poor, damaged copy of the film. For Ashby completists only.Of course, I only purchased this to finish off my Angelina Jolie collection (she had the most adorable chubby knees as a child!) and was prepared for the worst... Yet not prepared enough. Pointless. So pointless, even the characters seemed confused, and with Burt Young garbling all his lines it's a wonder you could even make out the GIST of what the man was saying. The 4-minute AJ appearance at the very end makes this one movie I never intend to rewind.The DVD of the Ashby cut of the film (which he'd donated without telling anyone that it had fifteen extra minutes) was released with great fanfare. Finally this film had a chance of being seen in the director's vision.Except that we are no better off. This is still a horrid film that goes nowhere.Ashby was a fine director who unfortunately got lost in a drug haze in his later years. Despite the enthusiasm of all concerned in the interviews on the DVD, this is a movie that runs out of steam very early. Voight plays an obnoxious character whom we don't pull for, and Burt Young is wasted as his buddy.I saw this film in the theater when it was released. For more than a decade I had jobs where I worked nights and saw virtually every movie that hit the theaters in my mid-sized town, sometimes two or three in a day - even driving to other nearby larger cities that got films we didn't. I watched videos quite a lot too. This is the only movie in my entire life I've ever walked out on... ever! There was not one single character that had a single redeeming quality. They weren't just flawed, they were broken. I couldn't identify/connect with them, I couldn't relate to them, I couldn't dig up a single scrap of empathy for any of the lot of them. John Voight's character was the worst as I recall, but dear Lord the monomaniacal self-absorption of those people was simply not entertaining. And to give you an idea of what I AM willing to sit through, I've watched Blood Sucking Freaks and finished it. But these characters were totally... repellent is the only word I can think begins to describe my response with any accuracy.I watch movies to be entertained, not tortured.This is not a comedy, even if it really tries to be, instead it often feels ridiculous.Now how can you be a friend to somebody who, when he gets lucky, spends all to finish depressed, and then jump up joyfully at the next occasion to get lucky.That's right. Manic depression, a mental disorder.Out stands the appearance of little Angelina in the end, obviously not good at acting, but she worked on it, and became much better then her father, who really acted to his best, but it was still acting, and the movie never came as a comedy. The movie may have been OK in the 80ies, but it has aged very badly.As Jon Voight quotes : Irresponsible people shouldn't have kids.This movie is rather a tragedy about a little girl and her father, going their own way.This is a disappointment for anyone familiar with the classics of Hal Ashby. Jon Voight seems to feel the need to scream every line (I guess he liked what he wrote!). It's one of those films that suffers from the absence of any likeable characters.I watched this movie while hung over and thought this movie to be splendid, absolutely a great movie, maybe due to being hung over. The star of the movies (Jon voight) character was crazy enough to be believable. This movie was transcendental. It made me concentrate on this movie without disruption, I couldn't be pulled away from the characters. I have never recommended anything but this movie I will. I would put this movie in with a good fellas feel of entertainment. If you see one old movie this year see this one. I heard this movie was out of print, if I could knew of getting this movie on DVD I would recommend it be brought back on DVD with passion."Lookin' to Get Out" is directed by Hal Ashby one of the most original and underrated directors of all time, but the 1970's was his best decade directing classics like "Being There" and "Harold and Maude". In the 1980's his final decade he release minor works and then died in 1988. In 1982 he directed this film written by Jon Voight about two gamblers trying to get away of trouble after one of them lose a lot of money on a bet. Alex (Voight) and Jerry (Burt Young) go to Las Vegas and they pretend to be friends of Bernie Gold (Richard Bradford) the owner of a hotel casino and enjoy a high class hotel suite and have some fun. But Harry (Jude Farese) the guy who Jerry owes money is trying to find them. And also there's time to see some old friends like Patti (Ann-Margret) a prostitute who was romantically involved with Jerry, now living with Bernie and her daughter (Angelina Jolie, very little making her first appearance on films). It's a comedy with two lost characters running away of trouble and creating another ones. It's very different from any other works from Ashby, it's empty, pointless, easy to follow in some parts, and no great acting. But it's enjoyable to watch and more easy to follow than "Shampoo" (great film but so many confusing and long considering that is a comedy). But compared to "Harold and Maude" this is a disappointment. What makes this film good is Burt Young who has a great and funny character, finally he made something so likable as much as Polly in the "Rocky" series. His best joke in the movie is ask Jon Voight's character every time she sees a smiling woman if she's a hooker. Voight, by the way, has a few good scenes, most of the time his shouting his lines and being annoying with his partner. Entertaining in some strange level, but if you expect clever humor, interesting lines or a original plot stay away of it because you won't find it here. 9/10accept I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But it took me forever to get, but because this the whole Brad-Angelina thing, and finally getting a real g/f (for awhile) made me loose interest in Jolie but I may pick it up again and because of the this hit and the upcoming release of The Good Shepard (2006)It has Jon Voight,and it also has the guy from the Rocky movies,&The Amitiville horrors 2. It also has tasteful nudity, a magic show,mature humor,even fighting! It also shows you the inside view of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas Navada, It also shows the streets of NewYork City.Oh yeah Jon Voight is SO cool! best of all his daughter has a small part in it she is so adorable. For those of you who don't know who she is she's the great great Angelina Jolie (voight) which name she's credited as in this movie, make sure watch the credits for that reason and another which you have to see for yourself... (she plays Tosh)I even got a different case from the one displayed on IMDbNow once I get the Mr.&Mrs. Smith's directors cut I officially have all of her movies!!!!!! = you can also see the MGM Grand hotel in Cher's believe tour which is on DVD,VHS,TV.(2016) Omen world has me corrected it has the previous MGM GrandIt's a bit of a Stoner Buddy comedy, I guess It may turn some people off, but I think the movie has a good ambiance if you ask me. People may think the characters seem to be shouting but that's what New Yorkers tend to do in any other movie (even if they don't in real life!)If you can get past the snickering and yelling, you may like this gem!ctitus924 states in the previous review that you can see the MGM Grand in Cher's Believe DVD - that is not true - the MGM Grand in this film was involved in a major fatal fire in 1980 and was then sold - it is now Bally's hotel and casino in Vegas. The MGM Grand in Cher's video is newer - it was built later and is farther down the strip. As for the movie- I am watching it now as I type and while it is great to see old Vegas locations, so far I am finding it a little slow moving...but interesting to see Vegas in the late 70's when this was filmed. There are some great clips of various Vegas acts and the cast of recognizable actors in the film is impressive.Five minutes into watching this film I began to wish I hadn't put it into the machine, and as it dragged on to its wretched conclusion I forced myself not to press OFF in the way that you sometimes cannot drag your eyes away from a catastrophe.I am unable find one redeeming attribute in this train wreck. The dialogue is simply awful. The acting is simply awful. The directing is simply awful. The story is simply awful.It is one of those movies where you wonder how anybody -- cast or crew -- could get out of bed and come to work on it day after day.If I could give it zero stars, I would. What a total waste of production time and money this debacle is. Yeeeechh!I'm a huge fan of Angelina Jolie and I have the full collection. I thought this was a horrible movie, but it's definitely a must-rent for any Angie fan. At 7 years old, she may only be there for a minute in the end, but it's all worth it...
